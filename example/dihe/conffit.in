###input file for conffit.sh - info of your system and QM inputs for Gaussian

##Informations for -c and -f options:

 # parameters to fit - look carefully to the mol2 file definitions!
   # if you have MORE THAN 1 residue, conffit.sh will need modifications in tleap input file for conformers generation!
   # if you don't wan't some parameter fitting, remove its section completely!

 # usage: atom TYPES | atom NAMES | range for generation of random conformations | N (terms, only in dihedral case)
 #	  bonds in Angstrom, angles and dihedral in degrees
   # N (terms) is how many sets of barrier, phase and multiplicity are necessary to discribe some dihedral that you wanna fit.

 $dihedral
c3 J3 SI QS | C1 CJ3 SI OQ1 | 0 180 | 1

##Informations for -c option:
 # new atom type info for tleap - if you don't need this, remove completely this section!

 # how generate conformations - random or fixeddt
    # default is random (you can remove this section)
    # with fixeddt, variation of parameter between each conformer will be calculated by: (range of parameter to fit / nstructures)

 #name of force field source, for tleap input - value before equal, maintaining spaces

 # energy cutoff (kcal/mol) for bad structures - value before equal, maintaining spaces

 # info for GAUSSIAN QM inputs - value before equal, maintaining spaces
 # other packages will need codification of conffit.in and conffit.sh!

##Informations for -f option:

 # parameters to fit
  # default: all terms are going to be fitted (equilibrium lengths, constants, etc), and you can remove this section
  # options - separated by spaces:
   # for bonds: REQ - fit equilibrium bond length
   #             KR - fit force constant

   # for angles: THEQ - fit equilibrium angle value
   #               KT - fit force constant

   # for dihedrals: KP - fit barrier term
   #                NP - fit periodicity term
   #             PHASE - fit phase term
