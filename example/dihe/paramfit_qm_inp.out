   WARNING: Insufficient dihedral information in sample structures.
            Your settings require at least 10 samples with data    
            at least every 0.314 radians (18.00 degrees).            
            Either 1) Add the missing input data or                
                   2) Set DIHEDRAL_SPAN to a smaller value or      
                   3) Set BOUNDS_CHECK to warn (not recommended).  
            Please read the help and/or documentation.
