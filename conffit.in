###input file for conffit.sh - info of your system and QM inputs for Gaussian

##Informations for -c and -f options:

 # parameters to fit - look carefully to the mol2 file definitions!
   # if you have MORE THAN 1 residue, conffit.sh will need modifications in tleap input file for conformers generation!
   # if you don't wan't some parameter fitting, remove its section completely!

 # usage: atom TYPES | atom NAMES | range for generation of random conformations | N (terms, only in dihedral case)
 #	  bonds in Angstrom, angles and dihedral in degrees
   # N (terms) is how many sets of barrier, phase and multiplicity are necessary to discribe some dihedral that you wanna fit.

##Informations for -f option:

 # parameters to fit
  # default: all terms are going to be fitted (equilibrium lengths, constants, etc), and you can remove this section
  # options - separated by spaces:
   # for bonds: REQ - fit equilibrium bond length
   #             KR - fit force constant

   # for angles: THEQ - fit equilibrium angle value
   #               KT - fit force constant

   # for dihedrals: KP - fit barrier term
   #                NP - fit periodicity term
   #             PHASE - fit phase term
